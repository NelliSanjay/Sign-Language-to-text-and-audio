Sign Language to Text and Audio Conversion
Project Overview
This project aims to bridge the communication gap for the hearing-impaired community by developing a system that converts sign language into text and audio. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the system captures and interprets hand gestures, transforming them into readable and audible formats. Gaussian blur is employed to preprocess the captured images, enhancing the performance of the CNN by reducing noise and focusing on the critical features of hand gestures.

Features
Real-time Hand Gesture Capture: Utilizes a camera to capture hand gestures in real time.
Image Preprocessing: Applies Gaussian blur to the captured images to reduce noise and improve the CNN's accuracy.
Sign Language Recognition: Uses a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize and interpret hand gestures.
Text Conversion: Converts the recognized gestures into corresponding text.
Audio Conversion: Transforms the text into audible speech using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
Technical Details
Hand Gesture Capture
The system uses a camera to capture hand gestures. OpenCV is used for image capture and preprocessing.

Image Preprocessing
Gaussian blur is applied to the captured images to reduce noise and enhance the significant features of the hand gestures. This step is crucial for improving the accuracy of the CNN.

Convolutional Neural Network
A Convolutional Neural Network is employed to recognize hand gestures. The network is trained on a dataset of hand gestures representing different sign language symbols.

Text and Audio Conversion
The recognized gestures are converted into text. The text is then transformed into speech using a text-to-speech engine, providing an audible output for the recognized gestures.

Technologies Used
Python: Programming language used for developing the system.
OpenCV: Library used for image capture and preprocessing.
TensorFlow/Keras: Libraries used for building and training the Convolutional Neural Network.
gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech): Library used for converting text into speech.
Flask: Web framework used for creating the user interface.
